# Damian Gillessen's Portfolio and Resume

## Introduction

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This project represents a significant milestone in my journey toward becoming a skilled Full Stack Developer. Having transitioned from various sectors such as casino and operations, I embarked on a Full Stack Development course earlier this year to pursue my passion for programming.

The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase my skills in design and development while highlighting my understanding of various modules and languages. Built solely with HTML, and CSS, this project serves as a functional static website where I demonstrate my capabilities, and hopefully earn a good grade in my first project submission.

Throughout this readme, I will provide insights into the project's development process, including the planning phase, user experience design, implementation of features, and technologies utilized.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio, and I hope you enjoy the experience as much as I enjoyed creating it.

## User Experience Design

In crafting this portfolio, I sought inspiration and guidance from key principles explained in "The Elements of User Experience" which was covered in the UX section of our course. My primary goal was to prioritize the needs and experiences of users, aiming to sculpt a journey that is both enriching and enjoyable for visitors.

## Project Planning Phases

I split the process of planning the project was into five distinct phases:

- Strategy Plane
- Scope Plane
- Structure Plane
- Skeleton Plane
- Surface Plane

### Strategy Plane

My Objectives:

- I aimed to facilitate seamless navigation throughout the portfolio.
- I attempted to ensure textual clarity to prevent user confusion.
- I hoped to evoke positive emotional responses from users to foster engagement.
- I strived to maintain cohesion and relatability across all content elements.
- Lastly, I tried to organize content in a manner that avoids overwhelming users.

User Objectives:

My Objectives for First-time Visitors:

- To be able to swiftly grasp the purpose and extent of the portfolio.
- To be able to effortlessly navigate between sections and pages.
- To experience a sense of progression while exploring.
- I hoped to avoid visual fatigue induced by excessive content.
- Lastly, I hoped they would be able to resume browsing seamlessly after any interruptions.

Objectives for Returning Visitors:

- The user should easily locate contact details or social media links.
- They should be able to understand the information presented and engage easily in any relevant portfolio content.

### Scope Plane

To effectively manage the project's scope, I adopted a phased implementation approach:

Phase 1:

- Create a first draft of an Introduction/Home page offering a succinct overview.
- Create a first draft of an About Me page, which includes the details of my CV or resume, my work experience and education and the option to download a copy of my CV.
- Create a first draft of a Gallery of previous projects I've worked on for users to explore.
- Create a first draft of a user-friendly and interactive Contact page for users to get in touch should they wish.

Phase 2:

- Make a detailed expansion of individual project pages.
- Gather feedback from peers and test the functionality of the site.
- Solve any bugs or issues that should become apparent.

Phase 3:
- Final testing on sites like W3C.
- Project submission.

### Structure Plane

Given the nature of the portfolio and the lack of text based content, considerable emphasis was placed on structuring the pages to sustain user attention and engagement:

Color Palette:

- Light Grey
- Grey
- Navy Blue
- White

As an avid night-mode user, I wanted to design the page from scratch with night-mode in mind. A dark background was chosen to reduce visual strain and elevate the prominence of images and the light text chosen to accompany the theme. The color scheme was meticulously crafted to deliver a visually pleasing and cohesive experience and images of a colourful and engaging nature were also included.

Typography:

- Raleway
- Open Sans

Consistent typography across all pages ensures readability and visual coherence - this is why I chose only two fonts to be used on-site. Diverse font weights and styles inject visual intrigue while preserving a professional aesthetic, so this was also kept in mind throughout the project.

### Skeleton Plane

Wireframes were meticulously crafted to visualize the project's layout and structure across diverse devices:

These wireframes served as a first-draft blueprint for page layouts and responsiveness. Iterative adjustments were made during development to enhance user experience and resolve usability challenges.

## Surface Plane

### Features Present:

- Responsive navbar facilitating easy navigation.
- Footer housing navigation links and social media icons.

### Features to Implement:

- I would like one day to make the contact page contact form functional with email notification capabilities.
- Incorporation of dynamic content such as videos or gifs.

## Testing

To ensure the optimal performance and functionality of the new site, a thorough testing process was conducted. The following steps were taken to verify the site's integrity and user experience:

1. **Cross-Browser Compatibility Testing:** The site was tested on multiple browsers including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge to ensure consistency in appearance and functionality across different platforms.

2. **Responsive Design Testing:** Various devices such as desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones were used to assess the responsiveness of the site. Testing was conducted to confirm that the site adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and resolutions.

3. **Navigation Testing:** The navigation menu and links were tested to ensure they lead to the correct pages and sections within the site. Additionally, the usability of the navigation menu on both desktop and mobile devices was evaluated.

4. **Form Validation Testing:** If applicable, forms on the site were tested to ensure that input fields validate user input correctly and provide appropriate error messages when necessary.

5. **Functionality Testing:** Interactive elements such as buttons, sliders, and dropdown menus were thoroughly tested to ensure they perform their intended actions without any errors or glitches.

6. **Content Verification:** All textual content, images, and multimedia elements were reviewed to ensure accuracy, relevance, and proper formatting.

7. **Accessibility Testing:** The site was evaluated for accessibility compliance by testing with screen readers and ensuring proper use of alt text for images and other multimedia elements.

By conducting these comprehensive testing steps, any issues or inconsistencies were identified and addressed, resulting in a high-quality, fully functional website ready for deployment.

### Future Testing

When possible it is hoped that I may implement the below testing processes on my site:

1. **Performance Testing:** Load times and overall performance metrics will be measured using tools like Google PageSpeed Insights and GTmetrix to identify and address any performance bottlenecks.

2. **Security Testing:** Security measures such as SSL certification, secure connections, and protection against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting will be verified.

### Validator Testing 

### Unfixed Bugs
