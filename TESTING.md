## Testing

To ensure the optimal performance and functionality of the new site, a thorough testing process was conducted. The following steps were taken to verify the site's integrity and user experience:

1. **Cross-Browser Compatibility** The website underwent rigorous manual testing within Google Chrome. This facilitated the evaluation of the site's performance across various browsers, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Brave Browser and Microsoft Edge, ensuring uniformity in both appearance and functionality across diverse platforms.

2. **Responsive Design Testing:**
The website underwent rigorous testing using the 'Responsive-Viewer' application within Google Chrome. This facilitated the evaluation of the site's performance across an array of devices such as desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. These were employed to meticulously assess the responsiveness of the site. This comprehensive testing approach confirmed the seamless adaptation of the website to an assortment of screen sizes and resolutions.

3. **Manual Testing:** The navigation menu and links were tested manually to ensure they lead to the correct pages and sections within the site. Additionally, the usability of the navigation menu on both desktop and mobile devices was evaluated. If applicable, forms on the site were tested to ensure that input fields validate user input correctly and provide appropriate error messages when necessary.

4. **Functionality Testing:** Interactive elements such as buttons, sliders, and dropdown menus were thoroughly tested to ensure they perform their intended actions without any errors or glitches.

5. **Content Verification:** All textual content, images, and multimedia elements were reviewed to ensure accuracy, relevance, and proper formatting. The text was reviewed using the Grammarly application within Google Chrome to ensure correct spelling and grammar was maintained throughout the site.

6. **Accessibility Testing:** The site was evaluated for accessibility compliance using the 'Wave' application within Google Chrome. This application evaluated the site for accessibility compliance to ensure compatibility with screen readers and ensure the proper use of alt text for images and other multimedia elements.

By conducting these comprehensive testing steps, any issues or inconsistencies were identified and addressed, resulting in a high-quality, fully functional website ready for deployment.

### Future Testing

When possible it is hoped that I may implement the below testing processes on my site:

1. **Performance Testing:** Load times and overall performance metrics will be measured using tools like Google PageSpeed Insights and GTmetrix to identify and address any performance bottlenecks.

2. **Security Testing:** Security measures such as SSL certification, secure connections, and protection against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting will be verified.

### Validator Testing

To ensure the validity and adherence to web standards, I conducted rigorous testing using various online validators and tools. The following steps outline the validation process:

1. HTML Validation: The HTML code was validated using the W3C Markup Validation Service to check for syntax errors, missing elements, and adherence to HTML standards. This was conducted on all pages of the site (see results for index.html below).

2. CSS Validation: The CSS code was validated using the W3C CSS Validation Service to identify any errors, warnings, or deprecated syntax that may affect styling and layout consistency.

4. Mobile-Friendly Testing: The site's mobile-friendliness was evaluated using Responsive Viewer and Google Chrome's Developer Tools, and testing on multiple screen sizes, device types, and orientations, including landscape and portrait modes. The browser compatibility was also tested in this way. The site was tested on multiple browsers and browser versions (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to verify consistent rendering and functionality across different platforms.
