## Testing

To ensure the optimal performance and functionality of the new site, a thorough testing process was conducted. The following steps were taken to verify the site's integrity and user experience:

1. **Cross-Browser Compatibility Testing:** The site was tested on multiple browsers including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge to ensure consistency in appearance and functionality across different platforms.

2. **Responsive Design Testing:** Various devices such as desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones were used to assess the responsiveness of the site. Testing was conducted to confirm that the site adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and resolutions.

3. **Manual Testing:** The navigation menu and links were tested manually to ensure they lead to the correct pages and sections within the site. Additionally, the usability of the navigation menu on both desktop and mobile devices was evaluated. If applicable, forms on the site were tested to ensure that input fields validate user input correctly and provide appropriate error messages when necessary.

4. **Functionality Testing:** Interactive elements such as buttons, sliders, and dropdown menus were thoroughly tested to ensure they perform their intended actions without any errors or glitches.

5. **Content Verification:** All textual content, images, and multimedia elements were reviewed to ensure accuracy, relevance, and proper formatting.

6. **Accessibility Testing:** The site was evaluated for accessibility compliance by testing with screen readers and ensuring proper use of alt text for images and other multimedia elements.

By conducting these comprehensive testing steps, any issues or inconsistencies were identified and addressed, resulting in a high-quality, fully functional website ready for deployment.

### Future Testing

When possible it is hoped that I may implement the below testing processes on my site:

1. **Performance Testing:** Load times and overall performance metrics will be measured using tools like Google PageSpeed Insights and GTmetrix to identify and address any performance bottlenecks.

2. **Security Testing:** Security measures such as SSL certification, secure connections, and protection against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting will be verified.

### Validator Testing

To ensure the validity and adherence to web standards, I conducted rigorous testing using various online validators and tools. The following steps outline the validation process:

1. HTML Validation: The HTML code was validated using the W3C Markup Validation Service to check for syntax errors, missing elements, and adherence to HTML standards.

2. CSS Validation: The CSS code was validated using the W3C CSS Validation Service to identify any errors, warnings, or deprecated syntax that may affect styling and layout consistency.

3. Performance Analysis: Performance metrics were analyzed using tools like Google PageSpeed Insights and Lighthouse to assess page load times, rendering speed, and overall performance optimization.

4. Mobile-Friendly Testing: The site's mobile-friendliness was evaluated using Google Chrome's Developer Tools, and testing on multiple screen sizes, device types, and orientations, including landscape and portrait modes.

5. Browser Compatibility Testing: The site was tested on multiple browsers and browser versions (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to verify consistent rendering and functionality across different platforms.

6. Performace Testing: The site was evaluated for performance using Google Chrome's DevTools and Google Lighthouse. See the results here: ![Interactive Gallery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DamianGillessen1989/personal-portfolio-dg/main/docs/lighthouse-scores.webp)

By completing this thorough validator testing I was able to identify and resolve any coding errors, accessibility issues, or performance problems, resulting in (hopefully) a compliant, user-friendly, and optimally performing website.
